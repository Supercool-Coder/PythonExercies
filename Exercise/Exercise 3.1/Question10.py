# 1 --> Write a program that calculates the area of a circle with a radius = 5. Use an approximate value of pi:  
  
# pi = 3.14 
pi = 3.14
radius = 5
#  Exponentiation Operator : In Python, ** is the exponentiation operator. It is used to raise the first operand to power of second.
value = pi * radius** 2 
print(f'Area of circle is :- {value}')
