# Question 3 --> Write a program that calculates the delta for the quadratic equation:
# 3x^2\ -\ 4x\ +\ 1\ =\ 0

# Print the result to the console as shown below.

# Expected result:


# Delta: 4

# Formula = b^2-4ac

b = 4
a = 3
c = 1
delta = b ** 2 - 4 * a * c
print(f"Delta: {delta}")
